\description{
The National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS) Riverside study. 
Immediately preceding the welfare reform
nationwide in the mid-1990s, welfare applicants in Riverside, California, were
assigned at random to either a labor force attachment (LFA) program (Z = 1) or
a control condition (Z = 0) in an experimental study. The LFA program, with the
goal of eventually weaning participants from the welfare system, emphasized
seeking and securing employment, offered job search services, and provided
incentives including a threat of sanctions should one fail to meet the program
requirements, while the control group members were guaranteed cash assistance
without the requirement for employment.
